Hi! I'm a PhD student at Georgia Tech trying to figure out how to make robots do all my work. My research is on Reinforcement Learning because it is the most promising framework for building intelligence. In my view, reinforcement learning can bind unsupervised and supervised learning in a way useful for taking actions in a real environment. These days, I am working on a small piece of intelligence: compositionality and curriculum. The idea is that humans never learn very hard tasks from scratch. We have years when we learn simple skills and build them up on top of each other to solve increasingly complex tasks. I want machines to learn to do
the same. 

I also believe that the reusability will be key to more general AI. Currently, if I train a Neural Network to identify dogs and cats, and I throw a panda into the mix, I will have to retrain the whole system from scratch with brand new weights. Or if in RL, I train an agent to pick up and drop of one passenger and I throw another passenger into the domain, instead of learning to simply sequence the two pickups/dropoffs in an optimal way, it learns a brand new local minima for the two passenger
case. It is ridiculously inefficient to retrain basic skills every time you want to add a new capability to an agent. It will be like building a very expensive rocket booster and only using it for a single flight. Who does that?

Oh, you're still here? Ok, I also strongly believe humanity has dwelled long enough on one planet in a universe of trillions and needs to move out of its parents' basement! We have to leave if we ever want to answer the hard questions such as "what the heck is going on out there?" and "what's up with life anyways? Is it special or pretty normal? lol". Unfortunately, our bodies have too much water and too little carbon fibre. We need something that is more suitable to harsh conditions in space but just as smart as us (or even more!). Robots are ideal for exploration and setting up a base before humans arrive. But they need to be more autonomous than they are because of the long distances and time delays involved. In order to build complicated structures efficiently, robots need to be able to work
with minimal human supervision, perhaps an instruction, maybe in the form of a reward or demonstration, every radio relay (15-20 mins for Mars).
