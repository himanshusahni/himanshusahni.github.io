“Read that to me again?” Michael swiveled his neck back towards Takinishi, who was leaning over the robotic arm in an awkward posture. Michael had his fingers poised over his oily keyboard, an empty bag of potato chips and half full can of diet coke next to it. One of his legs bounced up and down rapidly like a jackhammer. 

“32, colon, EF, colon…” Takinishi patiently read out from the specification printed underneath the arm.

“Jesus Mike, I thought you were smart! Can’t even remember a MAC address?” Colin said from the back of the room, a grin on his face. He knew this would flip Michael’s switches. 

“Says the guy doing nothing,” Michael grunted, back to typing furiously on his keyboard. He looked longingly at the diet coke, inches away from his rapidly moving hands. 

“Hey, I’m the physicist. I’m the brain behind this little operation we got going here,” Colin replied, waving a stack of calculations in front of him. He tossed his left leg over his right one, which was already on the white table in front of him. The table wobbled on its legs. The screws joining it to the tabletop were loose.

“How’s it going?” he asked Michael. Takinishi was also looking at Michael expectantly, still in his awkward posture. 

“90 percent,” Michael replied shortly, glancing once again at the coke. He grimaced, then gave in and took a swig out of it with one hand, still typing with the other. “I’ve cued the transfer, Taki,” he said, following a loud burp.

“Thank you,” Takinishi stood upright, his face red from being bent over the robot arm. He returned to his seat next to Michael.

“Compiled. Transferring the binaries to the arm,” Michael hit the return key triumphantly. He swung around to the others with a smug look on his face. No one seemed impressed. Crestfallen, he grabbed the coke again, tiled his head back and let the last few drops drip out onto his tongue. Colin stood up and went across the room to the balcony. He slid open the door slightly and a chilly breeze pierced through the stuffy room. Michael looked up from his screen, slightly annoyed but decided not to say anything.

“Do you think it will work this time?” Takinishi asked. No one chose to reply. Colin looked out over the city through the balcony. It was a clear night with an almost full moon. No stars though. Too much light for that. The Eiffel tower thrust out of the ground, glittering and twinkling, as though to make up for their absence.

“Upload complete,” Michael chimed, “powering up the containment field.” His fingers dancing on the keyboard again. Colin looked back over to their room. It was a small lab space they had rented out from Université Paris. A single fluorescent bulb washed the room with a bleaching light, sucking out all the colors so that only tones of gray remained. 

They didn’t need much space for their experiments. In fact, it was astounding how little physical stuff they actually needed given what they were set out to do. The first computer was a giant, filling an entire building. What they were doing here was much bigger than that. Yet their circumstances were very modest. Now if only that crusty old Dean of sciences would give them more of a power budget.

The machine they were building had two major components, a sender and a receiver. The sender was a small device, the size of a USB stick, with a black and white display from an old calculator attached to the front of it. The display showed a four digit number that changed seemingly at random about every second. There was a single red button directly below the display, with a power symbol drawn on it. The rest of it was featureless, polished to a shiny black. It was sitting on top of a small IKEA table directly in front of Michael’s workstation. It could easily be mistaken for a TV remote.

The receiver, on the other hand, was much larger. It was a closet sized contraption standing in the corner of the room. It was surrounded by pylons and a caution tape, not draped on anything, but just lying on the floor. Its body was made mostly of carbon fiber with a small doubly reinforced acrylic window near eye level. The matte texture of it seemed to suck in what little light there was in the room. The inside of the receiver was empty except for the containment field generator. The generator would need to be resupplied with fuel during transfer, which is what the robotic arm was for.


“Containment field deployed,” Michael said as the receiver slowly hummed to life. The arm started moving rapidly through a complex set of predefined trajectories. “Arm function nominal. Should I start?” He looked over his monitor to Colin. Colin gave him a small nod.

“Okay then,” Michael exhaled. He cracked his hand in front of him and turned around to look at Takinishi, who was staring at the monitor with his lips pursed. His hands were slowly turning a buddhist prayer mala. Michael never understood how a man of science could hold on to their superstitions. He had tried broaching the subject once, but Takinishi had lashed back stronger than he had expected. No one had talked about it since. 

“Transfer experiment 102. The time is 11:34 pm on Friday, 7th June, 2019. Containment field is at 100%,” Michael spoke into a microphone on his desk. “Tachyon intensity at 0.935. Sending frequency approximately 21.29 MHz, receiving frequency 17.55 MHz. Procedure commencing.” His leg bounced even faster.

The light bulb started flickering as the receiver sucked in power, humming with electricity.

“Power fluctuations within tolerable bounds,” Michael spoke into the microphone again. His attention remained fixed to his monitor which was painted plots of data streaming from the receiver. Colin and Takinishi’s eyes were glued to the receiver’s glass plate.

“Powered up. Activating sender device in 3…” Michael’s voice drowned beneath the rising groan emanating from the receiver. The lights flickered faster and then went out completely. The electric hum rose to a crescendo and then disappeared.

No one spoke for a second. Then flames leapt into life inside the receiver. 

“Taki, get the fire extinguisher,” Colin’s voice was steady and commanding. Michael knew that voice. Colin could stay level-headed in situations where others would succumb to their inner fears. Once, Michael had broken his ankle while they were backcountry hiking a section of the PCT. They had been climbing in the searing heat all day and in the afternoon came upon a small stream. Michael had foolishly jumped in, not realizing how strong the current was. He would have been swept away if it wasn’t for Colin’s quick reactions. The strong branch got him out of the water, but it was because of Colin’s calm that he had been able to bear the pain and not panic. Colin had left him all his food and water while he rushed to the nearest town, a grueling 16 mile hike, half of it in the dark. He didn’t berate him even once for his foolishness. 

The flame extinguisher whooshed loudly and filled the receiver with thick white clouds. The flames quickly dissipated. 

“Michael, backup lights please,” Colin looked at him. 

“Oh yes,” Michael fumbled with his keyboard and sent the empty coke can flying to the ground. He ignored it and quickly typed the commands into his terminal. Two floodlights blinked into life behind him, casting bright white light on sender and receiver modules.

Colin slowly walked towards the receiver. Takinishi was still standing besides it. The carbon dioxide clouds evaporated. 

When Takinishi saw what was inside, he dropped the fire extinguisher on the cement floor with a loud clang. His jaw slacked open and his whole body started shivering. Colin recoiled with a disgusted look on his face. 

“What’s in there guys?” Michael’s voice echoed in the suddenly hollow room.

The machine worked by syncing together frequencies of infinitesimally small particles called Tachyons between the two components. Tachyons were first theorized in the 60s, although their existence had not been confirmed till the Large Hadron Collider upgrade had come online barely a year ago. It was a monumental discovery. The principal investigator won an almost uncontested nobel prize but everyone realized that even such high prestige was not commensurate to the impact the technology would bring.

Tachyons had been so elusive because they are the only particles known to travel faster than the speed of light. Anything going faster than that cosmic speed limit must also experience time in the reverse direction of everything else. They were true time-travelers. The race to build the first time machine was on.

But it was not as many science fiction authors and even scientists had imagined. Although we had confirmed the existence of Tachyons, we had no way to control the frequencies with which they undulated back and forth through time. The sender module simply syncs nearby matter to a random frequency of Tachyon oscillation. The receiver does the same, but at a different random frequency. At any moment, by activating the sender, matter can be punched through to the receiver at the instant in time at which their frequencies matched. Because the frequncies of both kept changing through time randomly, there was no way to control the sending and receiving frequencies. So you could go back in time, you just wouldn't know when you would actually end up. 

Then there was also the fact that the sender ripped out an arbitrary amount of matter surrounding it. The micro-singularity did not distinguish between steel, concrete or human flesh. Studies on the relation between the sending and receiving frequencies and the radius of transport, as it was called, are ongoing but preliminary. Small hurdles, as Colin would put it.

“What is it?” Michael repeated his question. No one replied. He sprang out of his chair, and hurried towards the others. 

The clouds had cleared completely now so Michael could see through the open door of the receiver very easily. The inside was filled with gore. Blood was splashed all over the walls and pooling at the bottom. In the middle of it was a lump of meat and bones, charred and sizzling. The air was full of the smell of burnt flesh. Michael gagged and held up his hand to his mouth to stop the vomit.

“We must call the police immediately,” Takinishi broke the silence first. His accent had suddenly grown thicker, more Japanese.

“No! What?” Colin replied immediately. Michael turned around to him and saw that his hands were trembling. Colin noticed too and stuffed them in the pockets of his plaid pants. “What was the receiving frequency Michael? And why would be call the police? Don’t you know what this means? It works!”

“17.55 MHz,” Michael mumbled through his fingers.

Takinishi stared at him. “But it is human body!”

“No, no, no, no. We don’t know that,” Colin moved towards Takinishi. “We don’t know what it is. We don’t know when it came from. It could be an animal. It could just be random tissue. Someone may be trying to sabotage us. Why jump to conclusions like that?” He reached one arm out and kept it on Takinishi’s shoulder. “All we know is that just a moment ago there was nothing in there, and now there is something!” He chuckled, looking at Michael for support. Michael still had his hand on his mouth and could offer none.

“Look we will take precautions. We will seal off the experiment till we analyze exactly what we have here. We cannot just call the police. They will put us in jail. They will take the machine from us. This is perhaps the greatest invention by man, and we made it! We cannot let all of that science and progress get snatched up by some bureaucrat and buried under their countless budget cuts and what not!” He looked back at Michael for support again. Michael managed to nod his head vigorously, even though he kept his hand on his mouth.

“Look, why don’t you take off for the night. It’s late. Me and Michael will clean this mess up. No one got hurt tonight. Whatever this is we will figure it out tomorrow, and if it really is human flesh, then maybe we can call the cops tomorrow. How about that?” 

Takinishi did not look convinced, but he did look a little relieved. He also had been afraid of calling the police. It was easier this way. Perhaps it was just an animal. Why had he immediately thought it was human anyways? He nodded to Colin. 

“Great, go get some sleep, we will see you tomorrow morning.” Colin walked over to the door and held it open for him. Takinishi fumbled with his stuff for a second, realized he had dropped his mala and went back to the receiver to retrieve it. He scooped it up, careful not to look at the gore again.

“What do we do now?” Michael asked, after Takinishi had left.

“We clean up the mess and then we get back to work.” Colin’s voice was very low.

Michael could not believe Colin was actually that calm. He wished for once that Colin would tell him if he was also shitting-his-pants scared. “But there’s clothes in there Colin. This is no animal, you know that!”

Colin grit his teeth slightly. Truth was, he was scared. But he knew he couldn’t show it now. Not after they had all sunk their life’s savings and a year of hard work on this project. And it worked! How could the others not realize that small sacrifices have always been made in the name of Science. They had built a goddamn time machine! He wouldn't let this small… hiccup stop them from getting the benefits of their labor and brilliance.

“I am going out to get cleaning supplies. Cycle the circuit breakers and get the equipment ready again. Ban 17.55 MHz from receivers spectrum. We can squeeze in another experiment tonight. We need to test the magnetic field parameters again. I have hunch they may be behind the frequency fluctuations.” Colin grabbed his coat quickly and slammed the door on his way out.

Takinishi looked down at his Métro card. He had been standing at the turnstile for what felt like hours now, pushing the card in again and again, not realizing it was out of money. His mind was still on the gore inside the receiver. He had made a mistake. He had missed something but he couldn’t put his finger on what. He looked down at his mala and realized it was still covered in blood. He let out a gasp and threw it down reflexively. 

His head felt faint and tears were streaming down his face. He had made a mistake! How can he get forgiveness now! He found a bench and threw his body down on it, sobbing loudly now. He reached into his pocket to feel his mala. That would comfort him. He pulled it out and started counting the beads. He felt his breath easing, hands steadying. Then he looked down at the floor. Near the metro turnstile lay his bloody mala. He looked at the one in his hands, realizing with absolute horror exactly what he had missed.

He must confront them. They must confess.

Zombie-like, he walked back towards the sciences building. One foot appeared in front of the other without realization. He punched in their floor on the elevator.

As the elevator door chimed open, Colin stepped out of their rented room down the hall. Lip trembling and face white with shock, Takinishi stepped out. He held out a string of beads in front of him. “You did it! You killed me!” he pointed at Colin with the beads. Then Colin started barrelling towards him. 

<div style="text-align:center;">

“Taki stop!” Colin was chasing Takinishi down the stairs. Takinishi was in shock. He didn’t know what he was saying.

“You killed me!” Takinishi shouted back. “You killed me and sent me back in that box so no one would find my body. You thought I would go to police!” Takinishi was at the bottom of the stairs. He burst through the front door and started waving down passing cars on the street. He saw Colin coming out of the front door and he jumped out on the street. A car screeched to a halt right in front of him. The driver, on old, frail woman climbed hurriedly out of the car to check on him. Takinishi shoved her to the ground and drove off in her car.

Frustrated, Colin ran behind the car yelling out Takinishi’s name. Soon, he bent over grabbing his knees, exhausted. Taki had gone mad! What was he doing? Didn’t he know what was at stake?

He heard honking behind and and turned to see Michael in his mini Cooper waving him inside.

“Go go go!” Colin yelled even before he had closed the door. Michael slammed the accelerator and the car jumped forward.

“What are we going to do Colin? Did we ... I mean will we ... why is Taki saying we killed him?” Michael’s voice trembled as he looked nervously over to Colin. His face was full of sweat, small drops of which were dripping off his beard onto his lap.

“Everything will be okay, Mike,” Colin said. “We just have to talk some sense into him. We haven’t done anything wrong. We haven’t broken any laws.”

Takinishi was driving recklessly through the narrow Parisian streets, blowing past red lights. He was heading out of the city. Colin and Michael heard sirens behind them. They drove for what felt like an hour. They were outside the city now but they could still hear the sirens following them. Michael was surprised they hadn’t been caught yet. He extremely scared and started sobbing.

“It’s okay, just focus,” Colin said quietly now. They pulled up close to Takinishi’s car a few times. Each time Colin leaned out of the window and tried to tell him to stop. They were going very fast and Michael was terrified that Colin would get thrown out of the car. Takinishi would not listen though. They could see his silhouette sobbing and counting the beads of his mala inside the car. 

Suddenly he swerved off the road and went over the embankment. Michael slammed the brakes and the car screeched to a halt. 

“Stay here,” Colin reached inside his coat pocket and pulled out a hand gun. 

“What’s that?” Michael asked, fear filling his eyes. “What is that for? Colin no, we don’t need to do this!”

“It’s okay Mike, I will handle Taki. Taki has lost it. We should have never gotten him involved. It is all my fault. We could have handled the robotics ourselves,” he looked again at Michael. “It's ok. I'm just going to talk. It’ll all be okay. Our invention is too important for his stupid superstitions.” 

“No, Colin no!” But he was gone. He walked up to Takinishi’s car. It had crashed head first into a tree, smoke coming out from the engine. His hands trembled again. Don’t loose focus now. They will forget about this when they realize what he had created. He had harnessed the power of time itself! All he needed to do was buy himself a little more of just that. Him and Michael would figure out how to control the Tachyon frequencies and then they will be known as heroes. Humanity’s greatest inventors. Imagine the good they could do. Takinishi had lost it. Everyone will understand. He wouldn’t kill him of course. Just make sure he doesn’t harm the project.

Colin felt something crunch under his feet. He bent down and saw the mala in the dirt. He picked it up, shaking his head. Takinishi was in the driver’s seat, slumped over the steering wheel. The airbags had not deployed. He came to as Colin walked up to the window.

“Taki,” Colin swung the gun from hand to hand, “listen, we just can’t have you running around yelling murder. It will ruin all of our hard work and sacrifices.” Takinishi held his hands up in front of his face. Blood was flowing freely from a cut on his forehead.

"Colin."

“What is it Mike?” Colin turned around and saw Michael holding up something in his trembling hands.

Colin looked closer and saw that it was the sender. In the calculator display was the random frequency it was currently sending to. He remembered it from a little over two hours ago. 17.55 MHz. It felt like someone punched him in the gut.

17.55. The exact frequency at which they had activated the receiver in the lab. The exact frequency at which all the blood and gore had appeared inside the receiver. The exact frequency that the sender randomly chose at this very moment.

Michael was crying. “I'm sorry Colin. I can’t let you do this." He was looking at the sending display. "It has to mean something,” he said. Colin looked at him with disbelief. Michael pressed down on the red button.

"No Mike!" Colin made a grab for the device. Too late.

The air surrounding them cackled as thousands of joules of energy was released synchronizing the frequency of every atom of matter to the Tachyons flowing through them. Billions of invisible wave-particles resonated with flesh and bone as one and then instantly disappeared from that space-time. They showed up inside of a closet sized device about thirty kilometers away and two hours earlier. In between the flesh and bones was a buddhist praying mala, passing almost unharmed through the entire catastrophe. 

Inside the car, Takinishi slowly lost conciousness.
